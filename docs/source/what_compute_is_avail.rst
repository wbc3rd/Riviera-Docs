What Computing Resources Are Available?
========================================

Before creating your SLURM script, it's essential to understand your HPC system's infrastructure and current workload. This knowledge helps you decide which node or partition to target and how to request the right resources.

Inspecting Node Status with ``sinfo``
---------------------------------------

The ``sinfo`` command gives you a quick overview of all partitions and their nodes, along with their status. When you run::

   sinfo

you will see columns that typically include partition names, node state (e.g., idle, alloc, down, mix), available CPU cores, and memory. For example, an output might look like this::

   PARTITION  AVAIL  TIMELIMIT   NODES  STATE   NODELIST
   short-cpu  up     7-00:00:00  10     idle    node[01-10]
   gpu        up     3-00:00:00  5      mix     gpu01, gpu02, gpu03, gpu04, gpu05

In this output:
- **idle** nodes are free to run your job.
- **alloc** or **busy** nodes are currently in use.
- **mix** indicates that some resources on the node are allocated while others might still be free.
- **down** means that the node is unavailable for scheduling, possibly due to maintenance or errors.

Obtaining Detailed Node Information with ``scontrol``
-------------------------------------------------------

For a more in-depth look at individual nodes, you can use::

   scontrol show nodes

This command displays detailed information for each node, such as memory, CPU count, available features, and current state. This information is invaluable when your job requires a specific hardware or software configuration.

Allocating Resources in Your SLURM Script
-------------------------------------------

Based on the information gathered from ``sinfo`` and ``scontrol``, you can fine-tune your SLURM script. For instance, if you determine that GPU-enabled nodes are available in a "gpu" partition, your script might look like::

   #!/bin/bash
   #SBATCH --job-name=MyGPUJob
   #SBATCH --partition=gpu
   #SBATCH --gres=gpu:1        # Request one GPU
   #SBATCH --time=02:00:00     # Set the job run time to 2 hours
   #SBATCH --nodes=1           # Request one node
   #SBATCH --ntasks=1          # Typically one task for GPU jobs

   # Load necessary modules or set up the environment
   module load cuda

   # Run your application
   srun my_gpu_application

Similarly, if you notice that a specific partition has more idle nodes and is optimal for CPU-intensive tasks, you can adjust the resource request accordingly::

   #!/bin/bash
   #SBATCH --job-name=MyCPUTask
   #SBATCH --partition=batch
   #SBATCH --time=01:00:00     # Set the job run time to 1 hour
   #SBATCH --nodes=1
   #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=16

   # Load any necessary modules
   module load python

   # Execute your program
   srun python my_cpu_script.py

Resource Efficiency and Fair Use
---------------------------------

It is crucial to evaluate whether your job actually requires specialized resources, such as GPUs. GPUs can significantly speed up tasks that leverage parallel processing, but they are also a limited and highly sought-after resource. By accurately assessing your job's requirements, you avoid over-requesting expensive resources and help ensure that other users also have access to them.

Maximizing resource utilization is not just about improving your job's performanceâ€”it's also about system-wide efficiency. Optimizing your script to fully use the allocated resources, whether that means leveraging all available CPU cores or ensuring the GPU is actively engaged during processing, minimizes idle time and prevents creating bottlenecks. This responsible approach promotes a fair computing environment where resources are shared effectively among all users.

Summary
-------

By routinely checking the state of your compute nodes using commands like ``sinfo`` and ``scontrol show nodes``, you can make informed decisions about resource allocation. This awareness not only streamlines your job submission process but also helps you avoid unnecessary delays or resource conflicts when running your SLURM scripts.
